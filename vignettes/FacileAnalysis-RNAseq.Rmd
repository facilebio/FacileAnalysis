## Overview

This tutorial provides examples of how to perform common maneuvers employed
during the analysis of RNA-seq data within the facile ecosystem. Generally
speaking, some of the guiding principles of the analyses within the
FacileAnalysis package is that they are made in a modular fashion, and their
results (a `FacileAnalysisResult` object) can be:

1. transformed into tabular form via a call to `tidy()`.

2. interactively explored by the analyst using the `viz()` and `shine()`
   functions. These provide javascript- and shiny-based views over their
   results. The former is particularly useful when reporting results in an
   Rmarkdown document, and the later are useful when analysts are doing some
   self-exploration of their results while banging at this data through code.
   The modules used to create the shiny views can also be weaved together into
   larger interactive applications.

3. serialized into a more thorough set of interactive visualizations via a
   `report()` function, which is also suitable for use in an Rmarkdown
   document.

3. used as inputs to other analyses. In this report we show how:
   a. A `FacilePcaAnalysisResult` can be used as input to perform GSEA along
      a particular dimension.
   b. A `FacileTtestAnalysisResult` can be used as input to perform GSEA.

We will exercise these within this vignette. At the end of this tutorial, 
we will also show you how to run these analysis strictly via shiny gadgets and 
manipulate the returned objects with code, as well.

We will approximately follow along with the [rnaseqGene][rnaseqGene]
bioconductor workflow, which analyzes the [airway][airway] dataset using the
[DESeq2][deseq2] framework. This vignette will perform the analyzes outlined
there, and then provide the comparable facile version of the analysis.

:::note
The FacileAnalysis package currently only provides edgeR- and limma-based
methods for differential expression analysis. This does not represent any bias
against using DESeq2, as we are in fact very fond of it, however these were the
easiest ones to wrap into this package for now. Future versions of the
FacileAnalysis package may include DESeq2 as an option for performing these
analyses (especially if someone would like to provide a patch)!
:::

## Setup

Before we get started, you'll need to ensure that the facile packages are
installed and up to date. You should also be running the latest versions of R
(3.6.1) and Bioconductor (release 3.9).

The following call should be all you need to get going with the facile
ecosystem:

```r
BiocManager::install("facilebio/FacileAnalysis")
```

This should install all of the necessary Bioconductor and CRAN pacakges, along
with the following ones form github:

* [facilebio/FacileData](https://github.com/facilebio/FacileData)
* [facilebio/FacileViz](https://github.com/facilebio/FacileViz)
* [facilebio/FacileShine](https://github.com/facilebio/FacileShine)
* [facilebio/FacileAnalysis](https://github.com/facilebio/FacileAnalysis)
* [lianos/sparrow](https://github.com/lianos/sparrow)
* [lianos/sparrow.shiny](https://github.com/lianos/sparrow.shiny)

We also use data from the [airway][airway] and [parathyroidSE][parathyroid]
bioconductor packages, so make sure those are installed as well.

```r
BiocManager::install(c("airway", "parathyroidSE"))
```

## Data Preparation

The [rnaseqGene][rnaseqGene] vignette outlines how you can go from raw reads to
a quantitated experiment, that lives in a [SummarizedExperiment][SE], for
example. Those results are repeated (and stored) in the [airway][airway] data
package, which they then use for the analyses the perform there.

1. Add them to the `/static/img` folder
2. Reference the image using a relative path: ![my-image](/img/my-image.png)
-->

```{r se-load, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
theme_set(theme_bw())
data("airway", package = "airway")
```

### Prepare the DESeqDataSet

Let's create a `dds` object so we can perform the `DESeq2` maneuvers on these
data, and compare them with the facile version of the analyses. The workflow
suggests you perform some exploratory analyses using variance stablised
data, so we'll calculate that here, as well.

```{r dds, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dds <- DESeqDataSet(airway, design = ~ cell + dex)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
vsd <- vst(dds, blind = FALSE)
```

### Enable use of DESeqDataSet via the Facile API

The [FacileBiocData][] package provides wrappers around the core Bioconductor
expression container objects that allow them to be queried using the facilebio
API:

```{r facilitate, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(FacileBiocData)
library(FacileAnalysis)
ddf <- facilitate(dds, blind = FALSE)
```

This enables us to manipulate the data in the `ddf` dataset in the
"dataframe-first" approach used in the facilebio framework.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
samples(ddf)
```

Analyses begin by extracting some subset of
the samples from a FacileDataSet, which itself can have a potentially large
number of samples. Having a handle on the samples we want to analyze, we can
query the `facile_frame` to decorate it with any type of data that the
FacileDataSet has over them. This can be sample-level covariates, or 
measurements from various assays taken from them.

For instance, we can take these samples, and request to decorate them *with*
all of the sample-level covariate information we have for them:

```{r}
samples(ddf) |> 
  with_sample_covariates() |>
  select(dataset, sample_id, cell, dex, everything())
```

Or perhaps we just need to decorate these samples with a subset of the
covariates and some expression data in order to answer whatever our immediate
next question is.

The different assay matrices from the `dds` object are available using the
`assay_name` parameter in the `with_assay_data()` function:

```{r}
samples(ddf) |> 
  with_sample_covariates(c("dex", "cell")) |> 
  with_assay_data("ENSG00000101347", assay_name = "counts", normalized = FALSE) |> 
  with_assay_data("ENSG00000101347", assay_name = "vst")
```

## Principal Components Analysis

Let's jump to the [PCA plot](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html#pca-plot) section of the rnaseqGene workflow.

Plotting the samples on their principal components in the vignette was performed
with the following command:

```{r ddspcas}
plotPCA(vsd, intgroup = c("dex", "cell"))
```

That simultaneously runs the principal components analysis and plots the result.
This is fine for visualiztion purposes, but what if we wanted to work with the
PCA result further?

In the facile paradigm, we will first run the PCA over the airway samples, then
interact with the result of the analysis itself. Now, instead of just plotting the
data in the reduced dimensions, we can also identify which genes (and pathways)
are highly loaded on the principal components.

Unfortunately, we do not have access to the variance stabilized data within
the FacileDataSet. We will try to approximate this, however, by adding a higher
`prior.count` to the normalized data (counts per milliion).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pca <- fpca(ddf, prior.count = 5)
```

### Interrogating a PCA Result

The benefit of having a tangible result from the  `fpca()` function is that you
can perform further action on it. `FacileAnalysisResult` objects, like `pca` in 
this case, provide a number of functions that enable their interrogation at
different levels of interactivity.

#### Just show me the numbers with tidy()

For the most basic interpretation of analysis results, every
`FacileAnalysisResult` object provides its results in tabular form via a
`tidy()` function. For instance, `tidy(pca)` will provide the coordinates of the
samples used as its input in the lower dimensional space over the principal
components:

```{r}
tidy(pca)
```

The `ranks(fpca())` function produces a table of features that are highly loaded
along the PCs calculated. `signature(fpca())` produces a summary of the ranks,
by taking the `ntop` features positively and negatively loaded on each PC.

```{r}
signature(pca, ntop = 10) |> 
  tidy() |> 
  select(name, symbol, feature_id, score)
```

#### Deep Interaction via shine()

Using shiny to provide interactive modules that have access to all of the data
in the `FacileDataSet` provides the richest and most interactive way to explore
the results of an analysis.

For a `FacilePcaAnalysisResult`, the `shine()` method presents the user with a
shiny gadget that providesa an interactive scatter plot of the samples over the
PC's of choice. The scatterplot can be modified by mapping the various
sample-level covariates to the aesthetics of the plot. Furthermore, the user is
presented with the features (genes) that are loaded most highly along each
principal component.

```{r shine-pca, eval = FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
shine(pca)
```

<img src="images/animated/vignette-shine-fpca.gif" width="75%" />

:::tip
Users can also perform a gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) over dimensions of
an `fpca()` result using the `ffsea()` function,
[as shown below](#further-interrogation-of-pca-via-gsea), to better interpret
what biological processes the PC's might be associated with.
:::

#### Embeddable interactive graphics with viz()

We can embed a javascript-powered interactive scatter plot of the `pca` result
using the `viz` function. We use the `color_aes` and `shape_aes`, we can map the
same sample-level covariates to aeshtetics in the plot produced.

```{r}
viz(pca, color_aes = "dex", shape_aes = "cell")
```

This uses the normalized counts for the PCA analysis. If we wanted to use
the vst transformed data, we could have specified that in the call `fcpa()`
call:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
fpca(ddf, assay_name = "vst") |> 
  viz(color_aes = "dex", shape_aes = "cell")
```

### Removing Batch Effects

When we perform the differential expression analysis, we want to analyze
the treatment effects (`"dex"`) while controling for the celltype 
`"cell"`. The data retrieval functions in the core `FacileData` package 
allow for batch correction of normalized data using a simplified wrapper to 
the `limma::removeBatchEffect()` function
(see `?FacileData::remove_batch_effect`).

This functionality is triggered when a covariate(s) is provided in a `batch`
argument, as shown in the code below. Note that we set `ntop` to 5000, which
uses the top 5000 most variable genes for analysis (instead of the default
500). We do this to better perform GSEA on the PCA result afterwards.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cpca <- fpca(ddf, batch = "cell", ntop = 5000)
viz(cpca, dims = 1:3, color_aes = "dex", shape_aes = "cell")
```

#### Further interrogation of PCA via GSEA

We can even perform GSEA over any dimension of the PCA result via the `ffsea()`
function (Facile Feature Set Enrichment). This will rank genes by their loadings
on the specified PC of interest, then perform a pre-ranked GSEA test 
(by default, we use `limma::cameraPR`).

The core of our GSEA functionality is provided by the [sparrow][]
package. This includes easy accessor functions for geneset collection retrieval
(as a `sparrow::GeneSetDb` object), as well as delegation of GSEA methods for
analysis.

For this, we'll need a geneset collection stored in a `sparrow::GeneSetDb`
object. We'll use the MSigDB hallmark genesets for this purpose, and run both
`"cameraPR"` and `"fgsea"`.

```{r pcagsea, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gdb <- sparrow::getMSigGeneSetDb(c("H"), "human", "ensembl")
pca.gsea <- ffsea(cpca, gdb, dim = 1, methods = c("cameraPR", "fgsea"))
```

You can now interactively interrogate the result of the `pca.gsea` object via
the object's `shine()` method. This will instantiate a shiny gadget that allows
you to browse through its reuslts.

```{r shinepcagsea, eval = FALSE}
shine(pca.gsea)
```

<img src="images/animated/vignette-shine-pca-gsea.gif" width="75%" />

And you can visualize the loadings of the genes from a given geneset on the
principal component, like so:

```{r}
viz(pca.gsea, name = "HALLMARK_ADIPOGENESIS")
```

:::note
The GSEA functionality is performed by the [sparrow][] package.
Please read that vignette to learn more about its functionality. Also note
that performing GSEA on anything but logFC's or t-statistics (like
gene loadings on a principal component) is a newer feature of sparrow, and
the visualization needs tweaking (for example, "units" plotted need to be
updated (ie. logFC is shown here, but these are not logFC's).
:::

## Differential Expression Analysis

The rnaseqGene workflow tests the differential expression of the `dex` treatment
while controling for the `cell` identity. The design formula used there was 
`~ cell + dex`, and was set during the call to `DESeqDataSet()`. We'll just
materialize these results into a data.frame:

```{r rundeseq}
dex.dds <- results(dds, contrast=c("dex", "trt", "untrt")) |> 
  as.data.frame() |> 
  subset(!is.na(pvalue)) |> 
  transform(feature_id = rownames(.)) |> 
  select(feature_id, log2FoldChange, pvalue, padj) |> 
  arrange(pvalue)
head(dex.dds, 20)
```

On the facile side, we break down the differential expression workflow into two
explicit steps. First we define the linear model we will use for testing via the
`flm_def()` function.

To define which samples will be tested against each other, we first specify the
`covariate` used for the sample grouping. The levels of the `covariate` that
specify the samples that belong in the "numerator" of the fold change
calculation are specified by the `numer` parameter. The `denom` parameter
specifies denominator. The `batch` covarite can be used if there is a covariate
we want to control for, like `"cell_line"` in this case.

```{r flm-def}
xlm <- ddf |> 
  flm_def(covariate = "dex", 
          numer = "trt", denom = "untrt",
          batch = "cell")
xlm
```

Now that we have the linear model defined, we can perform a differential
expression analysis over it via the `fdge()` function. Using this funciton,
we need to specify:

1. `assay_name`: The assay container that holds the assay data we want to 
   perform the test against. The `xfds` dataset only has one assay 
   (`"gene_counts"`) of type `"rnaseq"`(`assay_info(xfds)`), so no need to
   specify this.
2. The method to use to perform the analysis. The methods we can use are
   defined by the type of assay data the assay matrix has. Our `"gene_counts"`
   assay is of type `"rnaseq"`. So far, we support the use of the `"edgeR-qlf"`,
   `"voom"`, and `"limma-trend"` pipelines for rnaseq analysis
   (see the output from `fdge_methosd("rnaseq")`).

There are optional parameters we can specify to tweak the analysis, for
instance:

i. `treat_lfc` accepts a log2 value which will be used to perform a test
   against a minimal thershold, using limma's (or edgeR's) *treat* framework.
ii. `filter` can be used to customize the policy used to remove lowly
   expressed genes. By default, we wrap the `edgeR::filterByExpr()` function
   to produce some sensibly-filtered dataset. Refer to the "Feature Filtering
   Strategy" section of the `?fdge` help page.
iii. `use_sample_weights` can be set to `TRUE` if you want to leverage limma's
   `arrayWeights` or `voomWithQualityWeights` (depending on the `method`
   specified).

You can see more details in the `?fdge` manual page.

To make our results as comparable to the DESeq results as possible, we will
pass the gene identifiers used in the DESeq analysis into the `features`
paramater so we get statistics on those same genes. 

We'll use the the voom framework for our initial analysis:

```{r fdge-dex}
dex.vm <- fdge(xlm, method = "voom", features = dex.dds$feature_id)
```

### Interpreting the DGE Result

As mentioned previously in the PCA section, every `FacileAnalysisResult` will
provide a `tidy()` function, which will provide the results of its analysis
in tabluar form. In this case, `tidy(fdge())` returns a table of the gene-level
differential expression statistics, such as the log-fold-change (`"logFC"`),
*p*-value (`"pval"`), and the false discovery rate (`"FDR"`).

```{r}
vm.res <- tidy(dex.vm) |> 
  arrange(pval) |> 
  select(feature_id, logFC, t, pval, padj)
head(vm.res, 20)
```

#### Deep Interaction via shine()

The `shine()` function over an `fdge()` result presents the user with the
table of gene-level differential expression statistics, which is linked to
a view over the expression of the gene of interest over the given contrast.

Since `"cell_line"` was used as a batch term in the linear model, the sample-level expression values plotted (by default) are batch-corrected. You can
toggle batch correction off to see the effect it has on the data.

```{r fdge-shine, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
shine(dex.vm)
```

<img src="images/animated/vignette-shine-dge-short.gif" width="75%" />

You can visualize and interact with a volcano plot as well. Drawing the volcano
plot is initially disabled, however, since it currently creates an interactive
scatter plot view over all of the (potentially thousands) genes analyzed. This
can overwhelm CPUs with lower end GPUs.

#### Embeddable interactive graphics via viz()

The `viz()` function on an `fdge()` result can be used to make a volcano plot,
MA plot, or to show the expression profiles of a set of genes across the groups
that were tested.

We can view what the differential expression of the top result looks like,
with and without batch corrected values.

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, features = head(vm.res, 1))
```

In the same way that you can disable plotting the batch-corrected expression
values per sample in the shiny gadget, you can also turn it off here, as well:

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, features = head(vm.res, 1), batch_correct = FALSE)
```

:::note
This is how you can query the `FacileDataSet` directly to retrieve these
expression values and plot them manually.

```{r}
dat.bc <- dex.vm |> 
  samples() |> 
  fetch_assay_data(features = head(vm.res, 1),
                   assay_name = "vst",
                   batch = "cell") |> 
  with_sample_covariates("dex") |> 
  mutate(type = "batch_corrected")
dat.o <- dex.vm |> 
  samples() |> 
  fetch_assay_data(features = head(vm.res, 1), normalized = TRUE) |> 
  with_sample_covariates("dex") |> 
  mutate(type = "original")

dat <- bind_rows(dat.bc, dat.o)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = dex, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(outliser.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = dex), width = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ type)
```
:::

We can also visualize the differential expresion result as a volcano plot, and
highlight which of the genes were also in DESeq2's top 50 results. By default,
these plots use webgl, but we still restrict it to only show the top 1500 genes 
in the volcano. You can set this to `Inf` to show all of them.

```{r}
viz(dex.vm, type = "volcano", ntop = 1500,
    highlight = head(dex.dds$feature_id, 50))
```

... or an MA plot ...

```{r}
# Instead of taking the top 1500, which leaves a solid empty space in the
# 'low-signicance zone', like the volcano above, we can pick a random set of
# 15000 genes, then highlight the top ones from the DESeq2 result.
# You an try the same trick with the volcano plot above.
viz(dex.vm, type = "ma", 
    # ntop = 1500,
    features = features(dex.vm) |> sample_n(1500),
    highlight = head(dex.dds$feature_id, 50))
```

#### Embeddable interactive summaries via report()

`FacileAnalysisResult` objects also provide `report()` functions. Their goal
is to weave together a number of views and statistics from an analysis that
are most presented together when we attempt to share analytic results with
collaborators within an Rmarkdown document.

For instance, when reporting a differential expression analysis result, it is
often convenient to supply a table of signficant results combined with something
like a volcano plot.

The `report()` function over a `FacileTtestAnalysisResult` will plot the
volcano of the `ntop` genes, and uses the [crosstalk][crosstalk] package to
link this to a linked table of gene-level statistics. The individual genes
provide link-outs to their information page on the ensembl website.

```{r}
report(
  dex.vm, ntop = 500,
  caption = paste(
    "Top 500 results from a differential expression analysis of the airway",
    "dataset treated and control samples, adjusting for the `cell_line`",
    "effect"))
```

### Using the edgeR quasi-likelihood framework

We have tested our contrast of interest using the limma/voom statistical
framework (`fdge(xlm, method = "voom")`), but you might want to use a different
framework.

Currently the following options are supported to test rnaseq-like data:

```{r}
fdge_methods("rnaseq")
```

You can swap out `"voom"` for any of the methods listed there. Let's use the
[edgeR quasi-likelihood framework][edgerqlf], instead:

```{r}
dex.qlf <- fdge(xlm, method = "edgeR-qlf", features = dex.dds$feature_id)
```

### Did the fdge() analysis work?

Now that we've looked at some ways to interact with our results, and tweak
the way in which they were run, it would be nice to know if the simplified
interface presented in the facile ecosystem runs analyses that produces accurate
and comparable results.

We can check to see how concordant the statistics generated by the `"voom"` and
`"edgeR-qlf"` methods produced via `fdge()` are when compared to the DESeq2
result. We'll join the results of all three analysis together to see.

```{r}
cmp <- tidy(dex.vm) |> 
  select(feature_id, symbol, logFC.vm = logFC, pval.vm = pval) |> 
  inner_join(dex.dds, by = "feature_id") |> 
  inner_join(
    select(tidy(dex.qlf), feature_id, logFC.qlf = logFC, pval.qlf = pval),
    by = "feature_id") |> 
  mutate(qlf.pval = -log10(pval.qlf), 
         vm.pval = -log10(pval.vm),
         d2.pval = -log10(pvalue))
```

```{r pairs-pval, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, fig.width = 6}
cmp |> 
  select(qlf.pval, vm.pval, d2.pval) |> 
  pairs(main = "-log10(pvalue) comparison", pch = 16, col = "#3f3f3f33")
```

```{r pairs-logFC, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, fig.width = 6}
cmp |> 
  select(qlf.logFC = logFC.qlf,
         vm.logFC = logFC.vm,
         d2.logFC = log2FoldChange) |> 
  pairs(main = "logFC comparison", pch = 16, col = "#3f3f3f33")
```

:::tip
The [`test-fdge.R`][fdgetests] unit tests ensures that the results produced via
the facile `flm_def() |> fdge()` pipeline are the same as the ones produced
using their corresponding standard bioconductor maneuvers over the same data.
:::

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

As is the case in the PCA -> GSEA analysis performed above, GSEA here is
performed downstream of the differential expression result. We need to specify
the geneset collection to use for GSEA, as well as the GSEA methods we want to
perform.

```{r, message=FALSE, warn=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
dge.gsea <- ffsea(dex.vm, gdb, methods = c("ora", "cameraPR"))
```

Calling `shine(dge.gsea)` on this GSEA result will pull up a shiny gadget that
allows you to interactively explore the signifcant GSEA results from from this
differential expression analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
shine(dge.gsea)
```

:::note
The shiny gadget will look similar to the one produced by running `ffsea()` on
the `fpca()` result, [depicted above](#further-interrogation-of-pca-via-gsea).
The screen capture is not included in this vignette to save (HD) space.
:::

## Side Loading Data (for svaseq)

The rnaseqGene workflow then outlines how one could use `sva::svaseq` to adjust
for unknown batch effects.

```{r deseqsva, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(sva)
dat  <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
idx  <- rowMeans(dat) > 1
dat  <- dat[idx, ]
mod  <- model.matrix(~ dex, colData(dds))
mod0 <- model.matrix(~ 1, colData(dds))
deseq.sva <- svaseq(dat, mod, mod0, n.sv = 2)
```

Although `svaseq` isn't directly supported in the facile workflow, we can
still do this by first extracting the data we need into objects that `svaseq`
can use, then marrying the surrogate variables that were estimated over our
samples back with the FacileDataSet for use within the differential expression
analysis workflow.

To extract the data from the FacileDataSet to initially run `svaseq`, we will:

1. Extract the counts used from the genes/samples in our differential expression
   analysis; and
2. Create a data.frame that can be used with the `model.matrix` calls above.

We can get all of the normalized count data from the expression container
with the following call:

```r
norm.dat <- fetch_assay_data(ddf, as.matrix = TRUE, normalized = TRUE)
```

This will use the stored library size and normalization factors within the 
FacileDataSet to retrieve all of the the log2(cpm) data from these samples.

We can do a bit better, though, in the sense that we can use the data normalized
in the same way as it was for the differential expression analysis. We can ask a
`FacileAnalysisResult`, like  `dex.qlf`, what samples it was run on using the 
`samples()` function:

```{r}
samples(dex.qlf) |> head()
```

You'll see what get a few other useful things, too:

1. The `cell` and `dex` covariates are added to the samples, because
   they were used within the `flm_def() -> fdge()` pipeline we ran.
2. The `lib.size` and `norm.factors` columns were added from the DGEList that
   was ultimately materialized and used within the call to `fdge()`. These were
   recalculated "fresh" after we filtered down to the genes that were specified
   via the `fdge(..., filter)` parameter.

Let's get our normalized expression data now:

```{r}
fcounts <- dex.qlf |> 
  samples() |> 
  fetch_assay_data(features = rownames(dat), 
                   assay_name = "counts", normalized = TRUE, log = FALSE,
                   as.matrix = TRUE)
```

These data will be returned in the same (column) order as is specified in the
`samples(dex.qlf)` data.frame:

```{r}
stopifnot(
  all.equal(sub("dataset__", "", colnames(fcounts)), colnames(dat)),
  all.equal(rownames(fcounts), rownames(dat)),
  # let's check only some values to make it quick
  all.equal(fcounts[1:100,], dat[1:100,], check.attributes = FALSE))
```

Now we have the pieces we need to run `svaseq` over our facile data:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fmod  <- model.matrix(~ dex, samples(dex.qlf))
fmod0 <- model.matrix(~ 1, samples(dex.qlf))
facile.sva <- svaseq(fcounts, fmod, fmod0, n.sv = 2)
```

As expected, the surrogate values calculated from both datasets are the same,
but it never hurts to check:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(deseq.sva$sv[, 1], facile.sva$sv[, 1], pch = 16,
     main = "SV1", xlab = "Original", ylab = "Facile")
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
plot(deseq.sva$sv[, 2], facile.sva$sv[, 2], pch = 16,
     main = "SV2", xlab = "Original", ylab = "Facile")
abline(0, 1, col = "red")
```

Now we add these to our samples facile_frame and redo the linear model and
perform differential expression analysis using only the surrogate variables
to contorl for batch (as is done in the rnaseqGene workflow).

```{r}
sva.qlf <- samples(dex.qlf) |> 
  mutate(SV1 = facile.sva$sv[, 1], SV2 = facile.sva$sv[, 2]) |> 
  flm_def(covariate = "dex", 
          numer = "trt", denom = "untrt",
          batch = c("SV1", "SV2")) |> 
  fdge(method = "edgeR-qlf", features = features(dex.qlf))
```

How do these compare with the original quasilikelihood analysis?

```{r}
cmp.qlf <- tidy(dex.qlf) |> 
  select(feature_id, symbol, logFC, pval) |> 
  inner_join(
    select(tidy(sva.qlf), feature_id, logFC, pval),
    by = "feature_id")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cmp.qlf, aes(x = logFC.x, y = logFC.y)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red") +
  xlab("logFC original") +
  ylab("logFC with sva") +
  ggtitle("logFC comparison with cell_line batch vs svaseq batch")
```

```{r}
ggplot(cmp.qlf, aes(x = -log10(pval.x), y = -log10(pval.y))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red") +
  xlab("-log10(pvalue) original") +
  ylab("-log10(pvalue) with sva") +
  ggtitle("pvalue comparison with and without svaseq")
```

### Visualizing effects of batch correction

We've tested two different methods of batch correction in this analysis
workflow. The first was to explicitly select `"cell_line"` as a batch effect.
The second was to use *svaseq* to identify unknown sources of variance we can
correct for.

Let's see how these effect the expression levels of a gene of interest.

```{r}
batches <- list(
  none = NULL,
  cell_line = "cell",
  SV1 = "SV1",
  SVboth = c("SV1", "SV2"))
dat <- lapply(names(batches), function(bname) {
  samples(sva.qlf) |> 
    with_assay_data("ENSG00000101347", batch = batches[[bname]], log = TRUE) |> 
    mutate(group = bname)
})
dat <- bind_rows(dat)

ggplot(dat, aes(x = dex, y = ENSG00000101347)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = cell), width = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~ group)
```

:::warning
`facile_frame` objects override dplyr-verbs, so most dplyr-based data
manipulations ensure that the `facile_frame` that is returned maintains its
connection to its FacileDataStore. Unfotunately, we don't provide a
facile-version of the `bind_rows` function, since it `dplyr::bind_rows()` isn't
an S3 generic because its first argument is `...`. We'll provide a workaround to
this in due time.

## GUI Driven Analysis

The analyses defined in this package should be equally available to coders, as
well as those who aren't proficient in code (yet) but want to query and explore
these data.

Gadget-ized versions of these analyses are available within this package that
can be invoked from within an R workspace. The same modules used in the gadgets
can also be weaved together in a standalone shiny app, that can be completely
driven interactively.

### FacileAnalysis Gadgets

The same differential expression analysis we performed in code, like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dex.qlf <- ddf |> 
  flm_def(covariate = "dex", 
          numer = "trt", denom = "untrt",
          batch = "cell") |> 
  fdge(method = "edgeR-qlf")
```

can also be done using the `fdgeGadget()`. Shiny modules for the `flm_def`
and `fdge` functions are chained together so that they can be configured as
above, and the results of the interactive, gadget-driven analysis below will be
the same as the one produced above.

```{r, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dex.qlf2 <- fdgeGadget(ddf)
```

<img src="images/animated/vignette-fdgeGadget-trim.gif" width="75%" />

Once the user closes the gadget (hits "OK"), the result will be captured
in `dex.qlf2`. You can then `tidy()` it to get the differential expression
statistics as before, or use this as input to `ffsea()` for feature set
enrichment analysis, either via code, or via a gadget.

The second call in the code below launches a shiny gadget to perform a GSEA. It
will return a result that is identical to the first.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
dex.gsea2 <- ffsea(dex.vm2, gdb, method = c("ora", "cameraPR"))
dex.gsea3 <- ffseaGadget(dex.vm2, gdb)
```

Try it!

## Closing Thoughts

We've covered a bit of ground. Here are some things to keep in mind.

1. Extracting a `facile_frame` from a `FacileDataSet` should be the starting
   point for most analyses. Tidy-like functions are defined over a `facile_frame`
   that allow the user to decorated it with more data whenever desired. The
   `(fetch|with)_assay_data()` and `(fetch|with)_sample_covariates()` functions
   are your gateway to all of  your data.

2. `FacileAnalysisResult` objects provide a number of methods that enable the
   analyst to interrogate it in order to understand it better.
   
   * `shine()` provides a rich, shiny-powered view over the result.
   * `viz()` provides will provide a variety of JS-powered views over the data.
   * `report()` will wrap up a number of useful views over a result and dump
     them into an Rmarkdown report, with some level of JS-based interactivety.
   * We briefly mentioned `signature()` and `ranks()`, but don't talk about
     why they are here. Briefly, analyses usually induce some ranking over
     the features that they were performed over. Like a differential expression
     result produces a ranking over its features (genes). We think that these
     are useful general concepts that analysts would want to perform over
     analyses of all types, and defining them will help to make analyses more
     fluid / pipeable from one result into the next. **More on that later**.

3. Analyses within this package can (should) be able to be conducted equally
   using code, a GUI, or a hybrid of the two.

This is still a work in progress. Not every analysis type is developed to the
same level of maturity. For instance:

* `report()` isn't implented for `ffsea()` and `fpca()` objects
* `shine(fpca())` is functional, but still needs some more work.

... and you'll find some other wires to trip over.
