**Under Construction**

* Performs PCA
* Easily explore PCs
* Extract the highly loaded genes (and genesets) from each PC

Easy to run a PCA over the rnaseq data, or whatever other assy you got there
(CNV, proteomics, take your pick)

```{r init}
library(FacileData)
library(FacileAnalysis)
library(dplyr)

pca.crc <- exampleFacileDataSet() |> 
  filter_samples(indication == "CRC", sample_type == "tumor") |> 
  fpca(assay_name = "rnaseq")
```

Vizualize the results:

```{r vizpca}
viz(pca.crc, color_aes = "subtype_crc_cms", shape_aes = "sex")
```

Need to fix up `report()`

Not sure how to `compare()` two PCA results ...

### Exploring Feature Loadings on Principal Components

The principal components are a new basis of orthogonal axes that are linear
combinations of the original axes, which in this examples are genes. By
exploring which genes (and gene sets) are most highly loaded along each
principal component, analysts can begin to better understand what biological
processes might be driving the variability in their data.

The `ranks(fpca())` result extracts the feature (gene) loadings onto the
principal components. `signature(fpca())` extracts the top N `ntop` features
from each principal component.

The code below returns the top 10 features over the first three PCs. The `score`
column corresponds to the loading:

```{r}
pca.sig <- signature(pca.crc, dims = 1:3, ntop = 10)
pca.sig |> 
  tidy() |> 
  select(feature_id, symbol, dimension, score)
```

When we map the expression values of the genes to the PCA `viz`, we can see that
the expression of the genes with high `abs(score)` values should track with
its position on its principal component.

:::note
```{r}
# We need to hack the expression values for these genes into the pca result for
# now, but we are working to upgrade the data retrieval abilities around
# FacileAnalysisResult objects so that this can be made effortless.
pcgenes <- c(IL8 = "3576", ARFGEF2 = "10564", BRIP1 = "83990")
pca.crc$result <- pca.crc$result |> 
  with_assay_data(pcgenes)

# The following issue tracks our intent to enable easier query/retrieval of
# data from different places to make interactive exploration more facile:
# 
# https://github.com/facileverse/FacileData/issues/8
# 
# Instead of hacking the gene expression data back into the pca.crc$result
# tibble, we should be able to do something like this:
# 
#   viz(pca.crc, color_aes = "feature:IL8|name")
```
:::

For example, we can see that *IL8* is highly loaded on PC1:

```{r}
viz(pca.crc, color_aes = "IL8", title = "IL8")
```

*ARFGEF2* is also highly loaded on PC1, but witha flipped sign:

```{r}
viz(pca.crc, color_aes = "ARFGEF2", title = "ARFGEF2")
```

and *BRIP1* is a highly loaded gene on PC2

```{r}
viz(pca.crc, color_aes = "BRIP1", title = "BRIP1")
```
